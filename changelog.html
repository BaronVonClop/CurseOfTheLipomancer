    <h3>11/15/2017</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>Random world generation added.</li>
        <dd>Not yet implemented, but now on game start the world generates a 5x5 world. Each one of these world
        tiles has a 10x10 zone in it. Functionally, this randomly creates a 2500 tile world, and can be adjusted either
        up or down.</dd>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>11/2/2017</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>Navigation section added.</li>
        <dd>Ugly as sin but hey, it functions. All cardinal directions.</dd>
        <li>First attempt at storing rooms.</li>
        <dd>I have no idea if this is how I am going to settle on doing so, but it is working SEMI well.</dd>
        <li>Character description button added.</li>
        <dd>Switches to character description. Can be used to show other shit too, probably. Maybe. Who knows?</dd>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>11/1/2017</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>Added character creation.</li>
        <dd>Still requires some work, such as making abilities actually function, adding descriptions, and finalizing
        some of the ability names/uses.</dd>
        <li>Started working on the actual game.</li>
        <dd>Main description window, and the basics of the status window are complete. Still need to figure out how the
         hell I am going to handle generating and displaying rooms. Oops.</dd>
    </ul>
